1.  I might be nitpicking, but since your Model.js (in the orm module) has change the arguments to call the Drivers; all other drivers are supposed to be changed either.

To be more specific, the Model.js now calls the drivers with five arguments but the other drivers (MySQL, etc) are still expecting four parameters.

A better solution is needed, or you should make sure they are all compatible. Otherwise the merged node-orm is broken.

2. There is one concern with single thread implementation. You've changed single.coffee with using pool, but I believe what was needed to do as per http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=836163&start=0 "But I assume that is also a bug as it should report that a transaction already started or it should block the transaction queries until the current one is closed/committed/rolledback." is to either block the queue till operation end or update the message. This was not provided.

3. In postgres.js lines:
+    var args = Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments);
+    var fields = args[0];
+    var table = args[1];
+    var conditions = args[2];
+    var opts = args[3];
+
+    var transaction = null;
+    if (args.length == 6) {
+        transaction = args[4];
+    }

> mentioned in Assembly spec 1.2.1

4.  ADS 1.1.4.1 and 1.1.4.2 should provide sample transaction rollback usage.
